This project was written very quickly one evening to give myself an emergency alarm clock after my phone was stolen.  As a result it is not very user friendly.

<h3>Overview</h3>

This project simply plays a YouTube video after a fixed period of time.  The alarm plays a fixed number of times at regular intervals.

<h3>Challenges</h3>
<dl>
<dt><em>Challenge</em>: Ideally, the user should be able to change the settings for the alarm.</dt>

<dd><em>Solution</em>: I didn't have time to add a user interface (as doing so would have caused me to lose sleep!) (To be revisited.)</dd>
